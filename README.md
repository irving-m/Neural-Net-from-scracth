# Neural-Net-from-scratch
This is a Fully connected neural network made from scratch, using only base python and numpy.

Heavily inspired by Samson Zhang's youtube video on the same topic, but extending the idea to a ANN with n layers.

I also followed along and used data from Harrison Kinsley and Daniel Kukiela's book, "Neural Networks from Scratch in Python". I used the data and results to contrast my progress, but the architecture and how the ANN is implemented differs drastically on my work.
